	General Notes:
This document is mostly for cutscene sprites and guests.
Enemy and boss animations, from what brief experimentation
I did on them, mostly consist of an innert mode, attack mode,
and specific attack functions. These would be better suited
to be catalogued in a different document, and I'm unsure how
useful they would be for more detailed scripted events.

The most likely numbers to find animations on are X0 and X1. 
The next most likely are X5 and X6. However, there enough 
exceptions that sometimes you'll just need to brute force
your way through all of them if you're looking for something 
specific.

There does not seem to be any standard convention for what
types of animations go with what number. They vary from entity
to entity. Many entities lack what seem like common sense 
animations (example: Curly's 0010 animation). It seems likely
that unless an animation was needed for a specific entity
while the game was being created, it was not enabled or 
implemented. It is possible the animations from one entity
could be applied to another through exe hacking, but that's
way beyond the scope of this document.

Many animations have duplicates. In my testing environment,
there did not seem to be any difference. However, the 
difference could be subtle or dependant on something my
environment lacked. For example, if my test room didn't have
drop-offs in it, I would not have detected that some "walk
forward" animations had a "no falling" aspect to them. If
I find differences at a later date, I will make note of them.


	Last Thoughts:
These are mostly the cutscene sprites that I will have need of
in my own project. I do not know if I will be getting around to
investigating and listing the animations for the other sprites,
so feel free to add to this document and add your "credits" to mine. 


	Credits:
This file is built entirely on the work of others, Pixel for 
creating Cave Story, and too many hard-working people in the 
community to list. These credits are not for recognition, but 
primarily for version tracking, to avoid duplication of effort.
