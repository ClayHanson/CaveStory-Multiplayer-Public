	 stored in file before being loaded into memory.  Actual
	 position and size of each section is defined in the section
	 header.

COFF Symbol Tables (18 bytes + 18 bytes per auxiliary table)

/*  SectionNumber values
IMAGE_SYM_UNDEFINED	  0	The symbol record is not yet assigned a section. A value of zero indicates that a reference to an external symbol is defined elsewhere. A value of non-zero is a common symbol with a size that is specified by the value.
IMAGE_SYM_ABSOLUTE	-1	The symbol has an absolute (non-relocatable) value and is not an address.
IMAGE_SYM_DEBUG	-2	The symbol provides general type or debugging information but does not correspond to a section. Microsoft tools use this setting along with .file records (storage class FILE).

/* Type Low byte
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_NULL	  0	No type information or unknown base type. Microsoft tools use this setting
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_VOID	  1	No valid type; used with void pointers and functions
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_CHAR	  2	A character (signed byte)
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_SHORT	  3	A 2-byte signed integer
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_INT	  4	A natural integer type (normally 4 bytes in Windows)
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_LONG	  5	A 4-byte signed integer
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_FLOAT	  6	A 4-byte floating-point number
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_DOUBLE	  7	An 8-byte floating-point number
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_STRUCT	  8	A structure
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_UNION	  9	A union
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_ENUM	10	An enumerated type
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_MOE	11	A member of enumeration (a specific value)
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_BYTE	12	A byte; unsigned 1-byte integer
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_WORD	13	A word; unsigned 2-byte integer
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_UINT	14	An unsigned integer of natural size (normally, 4 bytes)
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_DWORD	15	An unsigned 4-byte integer
/*Type High byte
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_NULL	0	No derived type; the symbol is a simple scalar variable. 
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_POINTER	1	The symbol is a pointer to base type.
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_FUNCTION	2	The symbol is a function that returns a base type.
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_ARRAY	3	The symbol is an array of base type.
*/

/* Storage Class symbols
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_END_OF_FUNCTION	-1 (0xFF)	A special symbol that represents the end of function, for debugging purposes.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_NULL	    0	No assigned storage class.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_AUTOMATIC	    1	The automatic (stack) variable. The Value field specifies the stack frame offset.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL	    2	A value that Microsoft tools use for external symbols. The Value field indicates the size if the section number is IMAGE_SYM_UNDEFINED (0). If the section number is not zero, then the Value field specifies the offset within the section.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC	    3	The offset of the symbol within the section. If the Value field is zero, then the symbol represents a section name.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_REGISTER	    4	A register variable. The Value field specifies the register number.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL_DEF	    5	A symbol that is defined externally.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_LABEL	    6	A code label that is defined within the module. The Value field specifies the offset of the symbol within the section.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNDEFINED_LABEL	    7	A reference to a code label that is not defined.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_STRUCT	    8	The structure member. The Value field specifies the nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_ARGUMENT	    9	A formal argument (parameter) of a function. The Value field specifies the nth argument.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STRUCT_TAG	  10	The structure tag-name entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_UNION	  11	A union member. The Value field specifies the nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNION_TAG	  12	The Union tag-name entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_TYPE_DEFINITION	  13	A Typedef entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNDEFINED_STATIC	  14	A static data declaration.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_ENUM_TAG	  15	An enumerated type tagname entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_ENUM	  16	A member of an enumeration. The Value field specifies the nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_REGISTER_PARAM	  17	A register parameter.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_BIT_FIELD	  18	A bit-field reference. The Value field specifies the nth bit in the bit field.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_BLOCK	 100	A .bb (beginning of block) or .eb (end of block) record. The Value field is the relocatable address of the code location.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_FUNCTION	101	A value that Microsoft tools use for symbol records that define the extent of a function: begin function (.bf), end function (.ef), and lines in function (.lf). For .lf records, the Value field gives the number of source lines in the function. For .ef records, the Value field gives the size of the function code.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_END_OF_STRUCT	102	An end-of-structure entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_FILE	103	A value that Microsoft tools, as well as traditional COFF format, use for the source-file symbol record. The symbol is followed by auxiliary records that name the file.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_SECTION	104	A definition of a section (Microsoft tools use STATIC storage class instead).
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_WEAK_EXTERNAL	105	A weak external. For more information, see section 5.5.3, Auxiliary Format 3: Weak Externals.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_CLR_TOKEN	107	A CLR token symbol. The name is an ASCII string that consists of the hexadecimal value of the token. For more information, see section 5.5.7, CLR Token Definition (Object Only).
