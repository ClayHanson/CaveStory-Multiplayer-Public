# CaveStory-Multiplayer
CaveStory, but multiplayer. Based off of v1.2 of the 'accurate' branch from https://github.com/Clownacy/CSE2 .

This repository contains **no** source code from *any* Nicalis-developed game. It only contains files and (decompiled) source code from the Free-ware version of CaveStory.

Development started in October of 2019.
