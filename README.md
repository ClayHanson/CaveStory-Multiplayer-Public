# CaveStory-Multiplayer
CaveStory, but multiplayer. Based off of v1.2 of the 'accurate' branch from https://github.com/Clownacy/CSE2 .

~~This repository contains **no** source code from *any* Nicalis-developed game. It only contains files & decompiled source code from the Free-ware version of CaveStory, most of which is modified.~~

This repository contains (loosely neatified) CSMP source code. As you've probably noticed, not everything is here.
I want to look through the all of the files before I release them to the public; Some of them contain source code from online sources, and I need to make sure they are properly credited.
This does not mean I am perfect; I will probably miss some credits. Just open an issue and I'll take care of it.

The development of CSMP started in October of 2019, and continued in earnest in December of 2020.
